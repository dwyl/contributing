Firstly, a ***heartfelt thank you*** for
making time to contribute to this project! <br />

> As a **_distributed_ team**, <br />
we **_need_** a **contributing guide**
with **simple steps** people can **_easily_ follow** <br />
**so that** we _avoid confusion_ and
**keep our _communication consistently crystal clear_**! <br />

Our contribution steps in a _nutshell_:

![validate-idea](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22287688/a929a9ae-e2eb-11e6-8d16-f2ebbebea080.png "DWYL's Contribution Guidelines Steps Diagram")

***Please*** ***inform us*** if ***anything*** is ***unclear***
or if you have _**a suggestion** for how to **simplify/streamline**_ it!

# Part 1: _Describe_ your Question, the Idea or User Story in an Issue

### _Why_ Use GitHub Issues...?

_Everything_ starts with a _thought_.
We collect _all_ our _thoughts_ in GitHub "issues". <br />
The issue can then be _**dicussed, validated**
and **worked on** as a **team**_ while keeping ***everyone informed***. <br />
We use _issues_ to _log_ our user stories, sub/technical tasks
and any ***progress*** towards solving the issue, <br />
this ***ensures*** we have a
[_**single source** of the **truth**_](https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference#why)
that _everyone_ can easily see!  


### Step 1: Check if the Question/Idea/Story/Issue _Already Exists_ Using GitHub Search ![search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22224334/255930a8-e1b6-11e6-9953-12cd4739aa1c.png)

1. Please take a moment to ***read through the existing stories/issues***
for the project <br />
to familiarize yourself with the _current_ "***backlog***".
(_there is a chance what you are thinking has **already** been **described**
  by someone else..._)

1. Try ***searching*** through the ***existing issues***
for _keywords_ associated with the story/issue you want to create, <br />
e.g:
https://github.com/dwyl/time/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20app+icon <br/>
if `"app icon"` were the keywords for what you have in mind
and you were searching in the "**Time**" project. <br />
![issue-matching-keyword-search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22225715/852d9f78-e1bb-11e6-9d20-37492da92dc1.png)

1. if you ***find*** an _existing_ issue that matches what you were looking for,
_please_ click on the title of the issue, ***read the description*** to
confirm if it's what you are looking for, then ***comment*** on it
so we know more than one person has the need/issue. <br />
> _**Note**: if there is **already an issue** for what you were thinking,
you can **skip** steps 2 & 3.
as there's **no need** to create a **new issue**_.
![issue-search-for-app-icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24758860/22225508/993c7ecc-e1ba-11e6-8a53-e8d2ac398546.png)

1. _Otherwise_, once you are (_reasonably_) sure there is
no _existing_ question/issue/story covering what you have in mind,
_please_ **create** a ***new issue*** (_see next step_!)


### Step 2: Create a New User Story _or_ Report an Issue ![New Issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22224203/bbc5efb4-e1b5-11e6-9fcb-3aae75ae74ed.png)

1. Using the `New Issue` button, create an **issue**
  for the ***user story***
  (_feature request, expected or **unexpected** behaviour, or question_)
  you have in mind.

> _**Note**: If you are **new** to writing "**User Stories**",
please checkout out our **Example User-focused Story Descriptions**
section in the "Notes" section below_!


### Step 3: Submit the _New Issue_!

1. Submit the new issue!

2. Once you _submit_ a new issue for a User Story or Question/Issue/Bug, a member
of the team (_typically the Product Owner_) will ***review*** the issue.

3. That's _it_ from the side of the _issue_ creator! (_thank you!_)

![thank-you-green-large](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22229077/5b0695ee-e1cd-11e6-9001-e5ff53afce36.jpg)

# _What do I do Next_...?

Once a new issue has been _created_,
it ***must*** be "***validated***"
by a ***different*** _member_ of the team/organisation.
(_see: "Part 2" below..._)


## :star: Star the Project! :star: (_share the love!_)
<!--
_After_ you have ***contributed*** to the project,
_e.g: by commenting on or creating an issue_, <br />
-->
If you've found the project interesting, helpful or useful in _any way_,
_please_ ***star*** the repository on GitHub! <br />
Stars show _other_ members in the developer community
that it's a _**worthwhile project** or **learning resource**_
and one that can offer value to other developers like you! 🌟


<br />

# Questions?

<!-- should the questions be at the END of this doc or
will people not scroll that far?
see: https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/pull/63#pullrequestreview-18508277
My idea was to structure
the content in in the order a Complete Beginner
(or at least a Person who is new to our Contributing Guide)
will *think* of it... So I've submitted my issue/question/bug-report
i.e: now what...?
So having these questions and corresponding answers here seemed
logical... but I'm equally happy for someone to re-org them
into a FAQ section with other contributing/process-related questions.
please make suggestions in issues! thanks!! -->

### _Why_ Does the Issue _Need_ to be _Validated_? >> One Word: _Communication_

This _may initially feel_ a bit "_bureaucratic_" but
we _urge_ you _not_ to think of it as <br />
["_jumping through hoops_"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jump_through_hoops)
but _rather_, _we_ think of ***issue validation*** as:

+ ***ensures*** that **everyone** on the project
is ***aware*** of the issue/idea/story.

+ ***saves you time*** by ***avoiding*** ***duplicating effort***!
> The **Product Owner** (**PO**) or **Project Lead** (**PL**)
has _detailed knowledge_ of the _current_ issue backlog
and all _previous_ ("closed") issues. <br />
They know _how_ features/functionality _should_ work and can
validate from the _user's_ perspective. <br />
***Most importantly*** the PO/PL ***knows*** if someone ***else***
is ***already*** working on the issue ... <br />
And, _sometimes_ the _exact_ same issue has been "***solved before***"
in a _different_ project, so ***hours/days*** of effort can be saved!!


+ ***someone else*** might have **insight** they can share on the issue! <br />
> e.g: if you have a **question** or are stuck on a challenge/problem,
[_**share** your **thoughts** and/or **progress**
towards "**solving**" it in **issue comments**_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nightwatch/issues/8#issuecomment-264734792)
you _never_ know when you will get _insight_ from a ***complete stranger***!

+ ***capturing information in issues*** _maintains_ ***relevance and focus***.
> the discussion is not "***lost***"
the way it would be in "_chat_"
and discussion are grouped by relevant topic.

+ ***clearly document*** the project so anyone _joining_ the team
_later_ on can see the "_history_".
> We have found this to be _invaluable_ when people are _learning_
why and how something works the way it does!


### How _Long_ Does it take for an Issue to be _Validated_?

We ***aim*** to respond to new issues within _**minutes**_
but during busy work days this can take up to ***a few hours***... <br />
(_**thank you** for your **patience**!
  **please** help us by giving as much useful information
  as possible in the issue description._)

<!-- Image removed so we can discuss an alternative ...
see: https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/pull/63#pullrequestreview-18510563
and https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues/62
![thinking-please-wait](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22228969/9add48f8-e1cc-11e6-8cdc-ef9b30eac846.jpg)
-->

### What can I do `while` I _wait_ for a my issue to be _Validated_?

+ If you are ***itching*** to help "move the issue/story along"
you can help by _describing_ how the story/issue _could_
be implemented or "_fixed_" ... feel free to ***describe your thoughts***
in a **_follow-up_ comment** on the issue you _just_ created!

+ **_Please_ do not write _any_ code _until_**
the story/issue/bug has been ***verified***
(_by the product owner or project lead_). <br />
(_It's not that we "doubt" anyone's abilities or the validity of ideas/issues
we simply don't want people "wasting time" or "duplicating effort"
on un-verified issues...
also there are **many** other ways you can help `while` you wait..._)

![what-to-do-while-waiting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22229403/5a08474e-e1cf-11e6-8c1f-858f3a167315.jpg)

> To help us **a lot**: go on a treasure hunt for an issue <br />
that _someone else_ created which has not had any comments ... <br />
or has not been _assigned_ to someone for investigation/work. <br />
this is quite easy to find by searching for a **label**:
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Adwyl+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

### Is it a "_Bug_"?

We also use GitHub issues to report "***unexpected behaviour***"
(_sometimes referred to as a "**bug**"_) in an app or module,
however we use the word "**issue**" to ***generically***
mean ***any*** thought/thing we want to ***record*** in the project
and share with the team,
and ***reserve*** the word "**bug**" for when a reported issue
has been ***verified*** as **not functioning** according to the
***expected behaviour*** in the ***user acceptance test*** described
in the ***original user story***.

> Please do _not_ use the word "**bug**" or apply the `bug` label
until the issue has been ***validated***.

<br /><br /><br />

# Part 2: _Validate_ the Need (User Story) or Issue _Exists_

> A _different_ team member from the person who _created_ the issue
***must validate*** the User Story/Issue.

### Step 1: _Confirm_ the Need in the New Story/Issue

1. When a new issue (_user story, feature request or potential bug_)
is submitted by someone, we _require_ a _different_ person to verify it. <br />
_Typically_ this verification of need
is done by the "_Product Owner_" ("**PO**")
or the "_Project Leader_" ("**PL**"),
but in the case that the issue was _created_ by the PO/PL then a _different_
member of the team will need to _confirm_ their _understanding_ of the issue.

1. The person acknowledging the user story will add some **labels** to
the issue to help ***categorise*** it. eg. `question`, `discuss`, etc.

1. (_More_) Labels can always be added/removed at any time. The purpose of
labels is to help the team categorize and prioritize issues in the backlog see:
[complete list of labels](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/labels)

### Step 2: _Assign_ a _Priority_ to the Story/Issue

1. ***Always ensure*** that the Story/Issue focuses on ***only one thing***.
As soon as you see the word "***and***" in a story/issue, you know it is
trying to do more than one thing.
+ ***If*** the Story/Issue has **too many components or features***,
  split the user story into "***sub-stories***"
  (_often reffered to as "**sub-tasks**"_)
  which you **link** to from the "main" story/issue.
  `-> Example of a Larger Story ("Epic") with Linked Sub-stories Required!`
  see: https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues/55
+ Product owner (or Project Maintainer) will add a
  priority label e.g: `Priority-2` to the story/issue.
+ Any/all Sub-Stories should _also_ be prioritized so that the team
can determine the _order_ in which they need to be worked on.

<br /><br /><br />

# Part 3: _Do_ the _Work_!

![get-it-done](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22265743/44a2ca72-e275-11e6-819d-2c5a1958ea11.png)

Once _all_ the previous steps have been performed
(_story/issue created, categorized with labels, any sub-stories/tasks
  created_)
and you are _sure_ you ***understand*** what is ***required***
(_make sure there are clear Acceptance Criteria_),
go for it!

### Step 1: _Estimate_ the Time Required to Perform the Work

1. For an _ongoing_ project, we estimate stories
  During "_Sprint Planning_" session; <br />
  A ***time estimate label*** (_e.g_: `T4h`  or `T25m`) is added
  to each story (_and any Sub-Stories/tasks_) <br />
  The time estimate **_must_ factor** time to:
  + ***document*** the changes made to the codebase or UI
  + ***test*** both the code (_unit/functional tests_) and UI tests
  + ***develop*** the feature (_or fix the "bug"_)
  + ***deliver*** by submitting a PR and going through a review/QA cycle.
  + ***deploy*** the work to an environment
  where a non-technical peopler can _evaluate_ it against the original
  story description and acceptance criteria!

+ Wherever possible/practical/relevant **include** the person who
  **_originally_ created the story/issue** in the time estimation discussion.

+ For work in sprints, a **milestone** is added **at the sprint planning
session** to group the user stories with its relevant sprint;
this gives _everyone_ in the team a **_clear_ picture** of what is ***planned***.

> _Please **See below** for "**Pratical Notes on Time Estimation**"_.

### Step 2: _Assign_ Yourself the Task and [_Do it_](https://youtu.be/M9-IZ1pNk00?t=45s)!

1. ***Assign*** the story/issue to yourself _before_ you start working.

2. ***Apply*** the `in-progress` **label** to the story/issue/sub-task so
  that your team knows when work started
  and that it is ***currently*** being worked.

3. ***Update*** the `README.md` ***before*** working on the task:
  _Ensuring_ you answer the questions: ***Why? What? How?***
  > This is referred to as
  ["***Readme Driven Development***"](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
  i.e: you ***document*** your work
  ***before*** you write ***any code***. <br />
  (_if this feels "tedious" to you, ask yourself
  remind yourself of the last time you
  "**inherited**" **undocumented code**..._) <br />
  **Watch**: ["**_The Mess_ We're In**" by Joe Armstrong](https://youtu.be/lKXe3HUG2l4?t=8m56s)

4. ***Log*** progress as
  [_comments in the issue_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nightwatch/issues/8)
  you are working on to keep everyone informed along
  the way (**_this allows people to help you more effectively and gives
    your team/client/stakeholders something measurable_**).
  + If you _haven't finished_ your current task by the end of the day,
  take **5 minutes** to **_describe_ the progress** you've made
  and what else (_still_) needs to be done - _anyone_ should be able
  to pick up and complete a user story by reading this description.
  + If you are leaving for more than a day,
  ***remove*** the `in-progress` **label**
  and ***un-assign yourself*** form the story.

5. ***Reference*** the **user story/issue/sub-task** you are working on
  by pasting a link to the GitHub issue
  in the **commit message**.

6. Once you have _commited_ your work/progress, push up your changes
  and then open a Pull Request _(even if the work isn't yet finished)_ <br />
  so that the rest of your team can easily see what you've been working on.
  (_remember ..._)
  + Add `[WiP]` before the title of your PR and add that it's
  **NOT READY FOR REVIEW** in the description if it's still in progress.

### Step 3: _Prepare_ a Pull Request (PR) and _Assign_ (_to someone else_) for Review

> **Rule (of thumb)**: _**Keep Pull Requests Small and Focused**_.

1. ***Describe*** what your PR contains in the PR description;
it only takes a _few seconds_
but ***dramatically improves*** the ***review process***. <br />
(_Please **never** leave the PR description blank!
  remember this is in an exercise in **communicating with your team members**_!)

+ Make sure ***all tests*** are **passing**
  and (_where applicable_) that your **code coverage** is ***100%***.
  + ***Never*** _comment_ out a test that is failing.
  (_Don't laugh, we have seen "**cowboy developers**" do this...!
  If a test is failing, the feature is broken!
  Fix the feature to make the test pass. Only then is your work "**done**"_)
  + ***Never*** _assign_ a PR for "_review_"
  _until_ _**all CI checks** have **passed**_.
  ![check failed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22284176/db2d698a-e2dd-11e6-8799-573226328b6b.png) <br />
  if _anything_ is failing on a PR and you _need_ help simply
  ***comment*** in the PR "_thread_" _asking_ for help!

+  **Increment** the _version_ of your application if it is a "_new release_".

+ ***Remove*** the `[WiP]` from your PR title.

+ **Remove** the `in-progress` label from the PR and associated issues.

+ ***Apply*** the
[`awaiting-review` **label**](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/49) to the PR.

+ ***Assign*** someone `else` to _review_ your PR. <br />
(_please don't merge your own PRs we need to ensure every change
has been reviewed by at least one other person on the team. thanks!_)

### Step 4: _Reviewer(s): Review_, _Comment On_ and _Merge_ the Pull Request

Always remember: a **Pull Requests** is a
"_**discussion thread** for **understanding** the code_",
our objective is to _ensure_ the code works, is well documented/tested
and is "_free from errors_". We don't
["_nit pick_"](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/nitpicking)
if it's going to delay shipping. Equally, where code requires _clarification_,
tell people; ***everyone*** benefits from _easy-to-read_ (easy-to-understand) code.

The person who is _assigned_ to review the PR
(_often referred to as the **Quality Assurance Person** or "**QA**"_) will:

<!-- should we be re-confirming that CI Checks pass before reviewing?
or should we *rely* on the PR submitter to have done the checks?
see: https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/pull/63#discussion_r97884381
1. ***Confirm*** that all "**CI**" ***checks pass*** _before_ doing anything else.
> Tests should all pass and "_test coverage_" should be _measured_
for every change/pull request. <br />
All our projects aim for 100% Test Coverage.
The project should also have a
[pre-commit hook](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-pre-commit) <br />
to check that the code has been "linted" and conforms to standard.
-->

1. ***Apply*** the
[`in-review` **label**](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/48)
to the Pull Request to signal to other members of the team that the PR
is being reviewed. (_at this point new commits which change large portions
  of the code being reviewed should not be pushed unless
  they are for changes that have been requested by the reviewer_)

1. ***Checkout*** the PR's _branch_ and run it on your local machine
following the instructions in the `README.md` where applicable.
> ***Confirm*** the tests pass and app runs on your local machine.

1. ***Open the Issue(s)*** referenced in the Pull Request
and re-acquaint yourself with the User Stories so you can
***confirm*** the content of the PR **satisfies** the ***Acceptance Criteria***.

1. ***Review*** the _content_ (_documentation, tests or code_)
in the Pull Request on GitHub...

1. ***Write comments*** or notes to the developer(s)
giving feedback on their code.
> see: "notes on code reviews": https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues/32#issuecomment-271089111 [![Get Help!](https://img.shields.io/badge/help-wanted-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues)

  + ***If*** for _any reason_ you are ***unsatisfied*** with the _content_ of the
pull request (_documentation, tests or code_), ***request changes***.
  + ***Don't be afraid*** to "_push back_" on a PR if the code is unclear,
***especially*** if the developer who's code you are reviewing is
"_more experienced_" because they _might_ be making _assumptions_ that
their code is "_self-documenting_"... <br />

+ Once you are _satisfied_ that the content in the Pull Request,
approve the pull request using GitHub's "_Review_" interface. <br />
![review-changes-submit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22298017/f45fa20e-e316-11e6-8fd6-d9825f5ce682.png) <br />
> We ***encourage peer-review*** by team-members on ***all*** our projects, <br />
so it's not _uncommon_ to see _multiple_ people "***approving***" a PR. <br />
e.g: https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collectionsonline/pull/708 <br />
![multiple-reviewers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22298408/54d24b7c-e318-11e6-9009-4b42bba4f5e4.png)

1. ***Merge the Pull Request***.

1. ***Delete The Branch*** on GitHub (_and your local machine_)
the code is now merged into another branch (_most likely `master`_)
so deleting the branch will not "_lose_" any code.

1. ***Finally*** _someone_ on the team
(_usually the developer who created the PR_)
applies the [`please-test` **label**](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/46)
to any issues mentioned in the PR so that the Product Owner and/or
User Testing Team are _aware_ that the feature is ready to test.

2. ***Ideally*** the ***Original Issue Creator*** should post a comment
confirming that the issue (User Story, Question or Problem) has been
adequately address and then ***close the issue***.
> In ***practice*** the PO often ends up closing the issue.

<br /><br />

# Notes on _Effective_ Contributing

### Thanks for Reading! Please Help Us _Improve_! [![Help Wanted!](https://img.shields.io/badge/help-wanted-brightgreen.svg?style=flat "Please Help Us")](https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues)

Thank you for reading _this_ far in this
[_huge_](https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues/28) readme!
Please help us by suggesting edits (_we're always happy to remove words!!_)
and improvements!

## _Example_ User-focused "Story" Descriptions

_**User stories** describe features_ (_or "**expected behaviour**"
of the application_) <br />
in terms of the ***value***
(_or "**benefit**"_) to the ***person using the application***.

  Example user story (_if the feature has not been described before_):
  ```
  As a person using the Web App
  I want to be able to save a shortcut app icon to my home screen
  so that I can easily get back into the app without having to navigate to it.
  ```
  or if you are reporting an issue/bug/fault try and include
  the exact steps to "_reproduce_" the issue. <br />
  example:
  ```
  when using the app on an iPhone 6 running the latest OS (10.2)
  when I attempt to save a shortcut to my home screen,
  I do not see an app icon. :-(
  ```
### Include Any/All _Relevant_ Information in the _Issue Description_

+ Please *include* as much ***relevant information*** as you can
so the Product Owner (_or project leader_) <br />
can ***validate*** if
it is a **necessary/desired** feature.

+ **Note**: A _good_ user story _describes_ the idea
  in a _**concise** and **user-focused**_ way. <br />

+ ***Never*** leave the issue _description_ blank
even when you are in a "rush" <br />
the point of issues is to _communicate_,
if you see an _incomplete_ issue flag it.
(_link your friend to here...!_)<br />
You _wouldn't_ send a _blank email_
to hundreds of your friends (_unless you wanted to freak them out!_), yet,<br />
submitting ***blank issues*** is doing _exactly_ that!
It sends a ["_I have **no idea** what I'm doing_"](https://www.google.com/search?q=i+have+no+idea+what+i%27m+doing&tbm=isch)
**message** to your ***peers*** ... <br />
Which was only _amusing_ the _first_ time ... _just_ ***communicate better***.


Example of useful details:
```
People using the app will only access the app from their company-issued
Android (Lollipop) Mobile phone (5 inch Samsung Galaxy J)
The screen resolution is 1080 x 1920 pixels
```
or describing a specific need for "_offline capability_"
```
People use the app in areas with poor mobile signal
so the app has to work offline and sync data/changes later
when they are back on WiFi or 3G.
```
or for a when reporting an issue (_potential bug_):
```
People using Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 report that
they cannot click on the button to save their app preferences/settings.
```

> ***Tip***: _if you **can upload** a_ ***sketch*** (_of the idea_) or
***screenshot*** (_of the issue_), it helps _clarify_ a lot! <br />
> ***How to take screenshot***: http://www.take-a-screenshot.org
(_all platforms_!)

Example creating a **New Issue** for an ***expected behaviour***
with a ***clear description*** and **_illustrative_ screenshots**:

## _Practical_ Note on Time Estimation for a Story/Task

Our time estimates are
usually for a ***pair of people programming together***. <br />
(_adjust accordingly if you're working without a pair.
or, better yet, **find someone** to pair with!_)<br />

Where the team includes _several developers_ the time
estimate will be the _average_ expected time <br />
for the two _least experienced people_.
Underestimating the expected time for a task out of "_naive optimism_" <br />
sets an ***unrealistic expectation*** and leads to ***stress & sadness***.

### _Revising_ a Time Estimate

If you are made aware of _any_ reason why the original time estimate
applied to a story is unlikely to be the _actual_ time it's going to take
to complete, inform your team as soon as possible!
Avoid _suffering in silence_ if you are _stuck_ on something just
because you don't want to alter the time estimate!
Nobody will "_hate_" you for being honest about how much effort it _actually_
is taking to deliver the work! Just tell your team
(_by commenting in the issue_) as soon as you know it's
taking longer than expected, and _ask_ for _specific_
help from your "***Scrum Master***" or "**Team Lead**".


### Estimating for _Open Source_ Modules (_without "sprints"_)

For independent open source modules or hobby projects
we **estimate** on an **ad hoc basis _before_ work starts** on the issue. <br />
Just because we are doing Open Source work does not mean we
shouldn't estimate the expected effort/time for our work. <br />
If anything we should follow our Contributing Guide ***better***
because our Open Source work is available for ***everyone*** to see! <br />
Some of our open source modules
are made to solve a problem in a client project/product. <br />
If you are doing work on an Open Source module during "client work" time,
please "mirror" the issue in the Project and _ensure_ <br />
you  **estimate in _both_ places** so the "PO"
(_AKA approver of invoices!!_)
on the project is _always aware_ of what you are doing.

<br /> <br />

## _Notes_ on Creating _Good_ Pull Requests

## 1. Keep it Small and Simple

+ Don't be _tempted_, to "_bundle_" up _several_ bug fixes/feature additions into
one _large_ PR and then submit it to be reviewed all at once... <br />
We prefer working in _smaller increments_ splitting the work
into individual parts to be reviewed separately. <br />
> _Why_...? Read: "***Work in Small Batches***": <br /> http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/02/work-in-small-batches.html

+ The _best_ PRs **update the documentation** (often the repo's readme)

+ ***Always*** _ensure_ there are **tests** for any new code you have written.

## 2. _Descriptive_ Pull Request Title and Description!

+ A **descriptive title** answers the question:
"_What is **included** in this PR_?"

+ A ***good description*** summarises the _contents_ of the PR and
gives the person/people reviewing the PR
a **clear picture/focus** for the feature/change/bug-fix
which ***improves review speed***.

+ ***Reference*** the issue(s) that the PR addressed in the PR description.

## 3. PR _Ettiquete_

+ explain what the PR includes (**bullet pointed lists**
  are sometimes helpful to make things clearer)
  and the _implementation detail_.

+ If you have the _permissions_ to do so,
**assign your pull request**
to someone (_else_) for review.

+ ***Never*** merge your _own_ pull requests on a **_team_ project**.
**No Exceptions**. Just ***don't do it***.

A good example PR: https://github.com/indexzero/ps-tree/pull/12
created from the ***need***
which was ***validated*** and ***discussed*** in
an **issue** https://github.com/indexzero/ps-tree/issues/10
***before*** _any_ work was performed.

<br />

## General Notes

### Images and Binary Files

When making a pull request, make sure that you haven't included
any ***unnecessary*** files that will take up a lot of space in the project!

Such files include images and other binary files like dependencies or drivers.
Git is meant for source code and other (_text-based_)
files that require version control.
Images and other binary files are difficult for a human to review
in a GitHub Pull Request and just take up a huge amount of space!
This means that when ever a person clones/pulls the code they have
to _download_ many/huge files
(_not just the code which is typically tiny by comparison_)

> It is a _general_ `git` "_best practice_" to avoid _clogging_ up your
Git repo with files that don't need to be under version control.

Guidelines for creating user stories are addapted from
[Simon's](https://github.com/simonlab)
[**user-story-checklist**](https://github.com/SimonLab/user-story-checklist)
repo. Check it out! :heart:


### Labels

GitHub can be a [_great_ project management tool]((https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference#why) if used _effectively_ and _labels_ are a great way to **organise** and **track** the progress of a
given project at any point in time.
They are a fantastic **communication tool**, particularly for [remote teams](https://github.com/dwyl/remote).

At dwyl we have created our _own_ standard list of labels
that we use for each of our projects. This gives our team the ability
to move between projects **quickly** and **productively**, saving time
and energy in the process.

and how they should be used, take a look at https://github.com/dwyl/labels.
